    <h2>About Me...</h2> <img src="images/patrick.jpg" alt="picture of patrick" width="200"height="200" />
    <p>I am a first time coder, but it was always something that I was interested in.  I was in Social Services for many years, but a series of
        of unfortunate <em>events</em> left me unable to continue in the field. I turned and made the j<sup>u<sup>m</sup>p</sup> to reinvent myself and here I am in
    the Cleveland Codes Program!</p>
    <p>My hobby is narrating short stories.  I love to see, hear, or read reactions to the audio.  I narrate all kinds of fiction.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Horror</li>
        <li>Fantasy</li>
        <li><abbr title="Science fiction">Sci-Fi</abbr></li>
        <li>Romance</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I'm game for anything as long as the story is interesting! I'd be glad to do a narration for anyone.  <br />

    <p>One of the most <b>important</b> things in my life is my family. It has been my honor and privilege to be a father and husband. Raising seven children is not 
    without its challenges but it has been the highlight of my time here on earth! I was married on the 14<sup>th</sup> of November in 1998 and it has been one <strong>heck</strong>   
    of a ride.</p>
    <p>	Desmond Tutu once said...<blockquote cite="https://www.brainyquote.com/authors/desmond_tutu">
    <i>You don't choose your family. They are God's gift to you, as you are to them.</i>
</blockquote>
I couldn't agree more! From the day I started my family, it has been a non-stop roller-coaster filled with every emotion imaginable! And I wouldn't change a thing!</p>
